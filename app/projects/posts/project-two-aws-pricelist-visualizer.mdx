## Introduction

**AWS Pricelist Visualizer** is a fullstack web application designed to make AWS pricing data accessible, interactive, and visually intuitive. The app lets users browse, filter, and compare AWS service prices using a fast, modern UI and a robust backend API. This project was a deep dive into RESTful API design, frontend state management, and cloud deployment, inspired by the need for a developer-friendly AWS pricing explorer.

## Key Features

* **Service, Version, Region, and Product Selectors:** Dynamic dropdowns let users filter pricing data by AWS service, version, region, and usage type, all powered by live API data.
* **Duration Selector:** Choose between different pricing models (e.g., On-Demand) with a responsive selector.
* **Search and Sort:** Instantly search and sort the pricing table by SKU, region, or price.
* **Professional Cloudscape UI:** Built with AWS Cloudscape Design System for an authentic AWS console feel and accessibility.
* **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Custom color utilities and responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS for a modern look.
* **Global and Filtered Views:** Toggle between global pricing tables and filtered results for flexible analysis.
* **Error Handling:** Graceful UI feedback for missing data, loading states, and API errors.
* **Deployed on Vercel:** Seamless cloud deployment for both frontend and backend, ensuring fast and reliable access.

## Technologies Used

* **React & TypeScript:** For a robust, type-safe, and maintainable frontend.
* **AWS Cloudscape Design System:** For professional UI components and layout.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For fast, utility-first styling and color management.
* **Node.js (TypeScript):** Backend API serving AWS pricing data, with strong typing and modular endpoints.
* **REST API:** Clean separation of frontend and backend, with endpoints for services, versions, regions, products, and pricing.
* **Vercel:** For CI/CD, serverless API deployment, and static frontend hosting.

## How It Works

1. **Frontend Bootstrapping:**  
   The React frontend (in `/frontend`) uses Cloudscape components for all selectors and tables. Tailwind CSS handles custom styles and responsive design.

2. **Dynamic Data Fetching:**  
   All selectors and tables fetch their data from the backend API, ensuring users always see the latest AWS pricing information.

3. **Backend API:**  
   The Node.js backend (in `/backend`) exposes RESTful endpoints for AWS services, versions, regions, products, and pricing. TypeScript ensures type safety and reliability.

4. **Monorepo & Deployment:**  
   The project is structured as a monorepo with separate `frontend` and `backend` folders.  
   - **Frontend:** Deployed as a static site on Vercel.  
   - **Backend:** Deployed as serverless functions via Vercel, with a custom `vercel.json` to route requests to the compiled JS output.

5. **User Experience:**  
   Users select services, versions, regions, and products via dropdowns, then view a searchable, sortable pricing table. The UI provides instant feedback for loading, errors, or empty results.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kgurnoor/aws-pricing-project
    cd aws-pricing-project
    ```
2. **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:**
    ```
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```
3. **Build the backend (TypeScript to JS):**
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
4. **Run backend and frontend (in separate terminals):**
    ```
    # In /backend
    node server.js
    # In /frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
5. **Visit the frontend:**  
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Deployment

* **Frontend:**  
  Deployed to Vercel as a static site from the `/frontend` directory.  
* **Backend:**  
  Deployed to Vercel as serverless functions from the `/backend` directory, using a `vercel.json` to point to the compiled `dist/` output and route all API requests.
* **Live App:**  
  [aws-pricing-project-frontend.vercel.app](https://aws-pricing-project-frontend.vercel.app/)

## Lessons Learned

* **HTML Structure Matters:** Hydration errors can occur if block elements like `<ul>` are nested inside `<p>`. Careful attention to semantic HTML is crucial for React and Next.js apps.
* **React Hooks Discipline:** Always call hooks at the top level—never conditionally—to avoid runtime errors and maintain predictable behavior.
* **Vercel Routing & Monorepo Setup:** Vercel only recognizes `/api` at the project root or inside the designated project root. Setting the correct root directory and output paths is essential for successful deployment.
* **TypeScript Across the Stack:** Strong typing in both frontend and backend caught bugs early and made refactoring easier.
* **Cloudscape & Tailwind Synergy:** Combining AWS Cloudscape for UI structure with Tailwind for custom styles resulted in a clean, professional look with rapid iteration.

## Future Enhancements

* **Support for more AWS pricing models:** Add Reserved, Savings Plans, and Spot pricing.
* **User authentication:** Allow users to save their filters and favorite services.
* **Performance optimizations:** Caching, pagination, and smarter API batching.
* **Advanced analytics:** Visualizations and trend analysis for AWS pricing.
* **Improved mobile experience:** Further optimize for small screens.
