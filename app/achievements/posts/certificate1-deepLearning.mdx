## Overview

I successfully completed the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course, the first part of the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. This foundational course provided a comprehensive introduction to the core concepts of neural networks, including:

* **What is a Neural Network?** Understanding the basic building blocks and architecture.
* **Neural Network Basics:** Logistic Regression as a simple neural network, cost functions, and gradient descent.
* **Shallow Neural Networks:** Implementing a neural network with one hidden layer.
* **Deep Neural Networks:** Building and training neural networks with multiple hidden layers.

This course laid the groundwork for understanding more advanced deep learning techniques covered in the subsequent courses of the specialization.

## Key Concepts Covered

* Forward and backward propagation
* Activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
* Weight initialization
* Vectorization for efficient computation
* Hyperparameters
