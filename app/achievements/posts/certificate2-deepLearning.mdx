## Overview

I successfully completed "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization," the second course in the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. This course delved into practical techniques to enhance the performance of deep learning models, covering:

* **Practical aspects of Deep Learning:** Training, development, and deployment considerations.
* **Optimization algorithms:** Exploring various gradient descent optimization methods like Momentum, RMSprop, and Adam.
* **Hyperparameter tuning:** Systematic approaches to finding the best set of hyperparameters for a model.
* **Batch Normalization:** Understanding and implementing batch normalization to accelerate training.
* **Programming Frameworks:** Getting familiar with TensorFlow.

This course equipped me with valuable skills to build more effective and efficient deep learning models.
