## Overview

I successfully completed "Convolutional Neural Networks," the fourth course in the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. This course focused on building and training CNNs for visual recognition tasks and explored state-of-the-art architectures in computer vision.

The course emphasized:

* **Foundations of CNNs:** Understanding convolution, padding, strides, and pooling layers.
* **Practical Implementation:** Building CNNs using frameworks like TensorFlow.
* **Modern Architectures:** Insight into LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and Inception.
* **Applications:** Including face recognition, image classification, and neural style transfer.

## Key Concepts Covered

* Convolutional and pooling layers
* Padding and stride mechanics
* CNN architecture design
* Residual Networks (ResNets)
* Object detection and localization
* Face verification and recognition systems
* Data augmentation
* Transfer learning
* 1x1 convolutions and Network-in-Network
* Neural Style Transfer
