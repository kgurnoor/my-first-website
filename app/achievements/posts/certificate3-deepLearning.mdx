## Overview

I successfully completed "Structuring Machine Learning Projects," the third course in the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. This course provided essential guidance on how to effectively structure machine learning projects, covering:

* **ML Strategy:** How to set up your machine learning project for success.
* **ML Development Process:** Understanding how to split your data sets (train/dev/test), bias vs. variance.
* **Error Analysis:** How to perform error analysis.
* **Training Neural Networks:** How to set up your data for neural network training.

This course equipped me with the knowledge to approach machine learning projects in a systematic and organized manner.

## Key Concepts Covered

* Orthogonalization
* Setting up development and test sets
* Bias vs. Variance
* Basic Error Analysis
* Building machine learning system
* Error Analysis
* Data Mismatch
* Learning from Multiple Tasks
* End-to-end Deep Learning
