Welcome to my June 2025 update! This month has been a great mix of hands-on problem-solving, deep learning breakthroughs, and dev debugging victories. Here's a breakdown of everything I've been working on:

---

## 🎓 Finished Course 4 – Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep Learning Specialization)

I completed the **fourth course** in the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera:  
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

This course introduced me to:
- Building and training ConvNets
- Understanding architectures like LeNet, ResNet, Inception
- Face recognition pipelines
- Transfer learning for performance boosts
- Neural style transfer (which was super fun!)

📜 [View My Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/HMS553ZQ1IFY)

I now feel confident using CNNs in practical projects and understanding how visual features are learned hierarchically in neural networks.

## 🌲 LeetCode Progress — Trees and Dynamic Programming

I focused hard this month on **Trees** and **Dynamic Programming** from the **Blind 75** list. Some of the problems I covered include:
-Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
-Same Tree
-Invert/Flip Binary Tree
-Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
-Binary Tree Level Order Traversal etc. 

🧩 I've been tracking my daily streaks and problems on my profile:

📝 [Blind 75 List](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/)

Doing 2–3 problems daily has helped me solidify recursion, backtracking, and optimal substructure thinking. I'm getting more comfortable with bottom-up DP and memoization techniques too.

## 🤖 GenAI Hack2Skill Exchange Participation

In last few months, I've been an active participant in the **GenAI Hack2Skill Exchange**, an event exploring practical generative AI applications and prompt-based tools. The hackathon is to begin on July 15th.

The training modules introduced me to:
- Prompt engineering concepts
- GenAI APIs and integration workflows
- Creative applications using LLMs

🎓 [Certificate of Participation](https://certificate.hack2skill.com/user/GenAI5-28M/2025H2S04GENAI-A01646)

This event has really encouraged me to continue experimenting with GenAI — especially as I build tools like Chat-with-PDFs.

## 🛠️ Debugged Tailwind + Next.js Deployment on Vercel

One frustrating but rewarding win this month was debugging a deployment issue with my **Next.js + Tailwind CSS** project i.e. my own website, on **Vercel**.

The project built fine locally, but Vercel threw confusing errors like `Can't resolve module` or ignored Tailwind styles entirely. After trial and error, I figured out:
- Correct folder structure for Tailwind config
- How to ensure all used classes are not purged
- Fixing path alias issues
- Validating the production build output before pushing

💡 I wrote a full blog about this experience so others don’t waste as much time as I did:

## 🚀 What's Next?

July goals:
- Finish **Course 5 (Sequence Models)** of the Deep Learning Specialization
- Complete the **Blind 75 list** entirely
- Start drafting ideas for a possible research project or blog series

Thanks for reading this far! I hope this gives you some inspiration to keep building, debugging, and learning.
