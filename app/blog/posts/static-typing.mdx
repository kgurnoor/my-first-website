## APOLOGY
I apologise for not posting weekly, I promise to update this website more frequently from now on.

## Course 1 completion
Just got over with course 1 of the 'Deep Learning Specialization' on coursera - "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", feeling accomplished and eager to dive into the next course.
There were 4 weeks and it was so hard to keep up with my college work as well, looking forward to better time managing skills from now on.

## What I learned
Course 1 was a great introduction to the basics of deep learning, covering topics such as:
- Introduction to deep learning and neural networks 
- Basic neural network architecture
- Concept of Vectorizing
- Broadcasting in python
- Activation functions

## Further goals : 
- Completing the next course in the specialization, which is "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning
- doing at least 10 questions of the "Blind 75" problem set on LeetCode
- Acing my college quizzes and assignments

## Conclusion 
See you soon!
