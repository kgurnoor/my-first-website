This is an update post , I'll explain them one by one

## College Mid-terms
I have been pretty busy preparing and attempting for my mid semester exams. Although it took a lot of caffeine and sleepless nights, it was a thrilling experience overall.
I am in 4th semester of my 8 semester degree and I currently have 6 core courses. All these are relevant to Computer Science.
I am actually so excited to learn about each of them because I feel like they made me feel closer to my field. It's a hard and long journey but I'm willing to give it my all!

## PWOC 
So my college Coding Club has given me the opportunity to participate in an event , somewhat inspired from GSOC - Google Summer Of Code, i.e. PWOC - Pec Winter Of Code.
It's a contest where I will have to contribute to an open source project, and by making a relatively good contribution, my work will be appreciated.
Honestly, I have not done this before but I am so excited to dive into open source, and always have wanted to do so. Let's see where this goes

## My first LLM Project - Chat-with-PDFs
This one is quite exciting. Its the second day I've been working on this project. I have gained a LOT of knowledge about various llms, embedders, vector storage, other AI models. I have posted my learnings on my github README file, check it out 'https://github.com/kgurnoor/ask-multiple-pdfs.git'
It's base project is taken from here : 'https://github.com/alejandro-ao/ask-multiple-pdfs.git'

## LeetCode
Quite a productive few weeks! I've reached to the DP section of the Blind75 problems. I think I'm started to like problem solving more than ever before. I feel motivated to solve more and more each day.
It's going good, trying to stay consistent with it. I try to do 2 problems everyday.

## Completed Course 2 - Deep Learning Specialization
Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks:Hyperparamter Tuning , Regularization and Optimization
Got the certificate and posted it on Linkedin today itself, gained so many insightful skills : hyperparameter tuning, Tensorflow, Mathematical Optimization
Today's goal is to complete the Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning projects

## Conclusion
As I reflect on the past few weeks, I'm excited about the progress I've made across various fronts. 
From navigating college mid-terms to diving into open source through PWOC, and from exploring new project ideas like "Chat-with-PDFs" to advancing in LeetCode and the Deep Learning Specialization,
it's been a journey of growth and learning. I'm looking forward to continuing this momentum, especially as I delve deeper into open source contributions and machine learning projects.
Thanks for following along, and I hope you find these updates as inspiring as I do!
