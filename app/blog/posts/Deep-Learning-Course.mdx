So this week i started this deep learning course on Coursera , here is the link : 'https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning'
I have been very keen on learning more about Data Science and Machine Learning as I studied about it in this semester at my college.
I began with the Course 1 : Neural Network and Deep Learning. I am really enjoying it so far. I am learning about the basics of neural networks, how they are applied in real life.

The next 4 Courses are :
Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks:Hyperparamter Tuning , Regularization and Optimization
Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning projects
Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
Course 5: Sequence Models

Lets see how it goes next.
