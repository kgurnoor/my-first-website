summary: 'The day I created my first website using Vercel'
---

I have been very keen on making a website for my portfolio since a long time . I finally decided to take the plunge and create one. I chose Vercel as my platform
## Buying the domain name

My brother helped me to buy the domain name from namecheap.com. I chose a simple name, `gurnoor.net`.   

## Linking with vercel
I linked my domain name with my vercel project. 

## Making edits
I don't have much knowledge of java,html and css, I do excel in python, C++ and C tho23wesdxugh. I had to learn a lot of new things. I started with getting to understand the template code using perplexityAI.
These are the following edits I made:
1. I changed the links to my github and linkedin profiles.
2. I added my email and phone number at the bottom.

## Conclusion
There are various changes yet to be made but I will keep the blog updated with each edit I make into my website.
